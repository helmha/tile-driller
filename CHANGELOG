CHANGELOG

i (Ville Helin) admit, i didn't write tile driller completely myself.
;) thanks to boo_boo for lots of code seen in 1.8 (the logic for
background color and the fix for BMP files)! and thanks to setok for
good ideas. and pasi kallinen is responsible of most of the very cool
features in 2.1! nice!

HISTORY

v2.2 (06-Apr-2007): * reading of grayscale PNGs should work.
                    * added new drawing tools: 3x3 pen, 5x5 pen,
                      and 7x7 pen.
                    * removed line, rectangle and circle drawing
                      tools as they just didn't work.
                    * when using alt to change the tools, the editor
                      window's status line is also refreshed.
                    * added two new fill tools: aggressive fill and
                      gradient fill.

v2.1 (26-Feb-2005): * added erosion operation.
                    p code cleanups, less bloat.
                    * reading of 8bit PNG files with transparency should work.
                    * small optimizations.
                    p when selecting the shown tile in the memory-window,
                      the selection centers on the mouse cursor.
                    p zooming can now be done is discrete steps, instead
                      of having fixed zoom values.
                    p editor window has a status line at the bottom.
                    p added an undo stack, so you can do more than 1 undo.
                    p added visible grid.
                    p grid size and editor-window size are independent.
                    p added new drawing tools: line, rectangle and circle.

v2.0 (15-May-2004): * added new tiled view size: 1x1.
                    * added new tiled view zoom modes: 500% and 1000%.
                    * added revert menu option to the memory window.
                    * changed the asterisk symbol in the menubars to pipe.
                    * shrinking the image and having unchecked snap-to-grid
                      doesn't possibly crash tile driller any more.
                    * reading of 16bit PNG files should work.
                    * PNG saving could crash (a very rare bug).
                    * optimized window updates a bit.

v1.9 (28-Jan-2004): * tile driller can now load TGA files, too.
                    * fixed few possible crashes introduced in v1.8.
                    * code cleanups.
                    * small optimizations here and there.

v1.8 (12-Jan-2004): * palette and tiled view window origins are now
                      captured when the windows are closed, not only
                      at exit.
                    * made the preference file reader more robust.
                    * added more information into the tiled view
                      window titlebar.
                    b added background color.
                    b all image clear operations are performed using
                      the background color.
                    b BMP image loader flipped the image.
                    * fixed few mouse pointer pixel quirks in the
                      editor window.

v1.7 (17-Dec-2003): * the user can now hide palette and tiled view
                      windows completely.
                    * added image scaling, and undo.
                    * tile driller now saves and loads its
                      preferences.
                    * tile loading saves now undo data.
                    * the "open"-dialogs inherit the paths from the
                      "save as"-dialogs.
                    * the color pickers round the values of the color
                      components up to the nearest integer, not down,
                      to obtain the correct result.

v1.6 (09-Dec-2003): * added another image size: 2048x2048.
                    * added new editor window zoom mode: 100%.
                    * added new tile sizes: 512x512 and 1024x1024.
                    * added more information into the memory window
                      tittlebar.
                    * added tile saving and loading.
                    * added tile scaling: 50%, 25% and 12.5%.
                    * compressed the editor window menus.
                    * optimized memory window updating a lot.
                    * resizing the memory window to be smaller than the
                      tile will not crash tile driller anymore.
                    * resizing the tile warps the editor window to
                      the nearest tile, not to tile 0.
                    * the memory window can now be resized, and scrollbars
                      appear when the image is larger than the window.
                    * tile driller can now load PCX files, too.
                    * tiled view window can be toggled off.

v1.5 (03-Dec-2003): * moved the mirror operators from the filters-menu
                      to edit-menu.
                    * added two new tools: blur (gaussian) and blur
                      (normal).
                    * added mirror & blend -operators (left->right and
                      top->bottom, linear and stochastic).
                    * added another image size: 1024x1024.
                    * the "save as"-dialog inherits the path from the
                      "open"-dialog.
                    * the image window title shows only the filename,
                      not the full path.

v1.4 (25-Nov-2003): * added filters-menu to the editor window with
                      blur (gaussian), blur (normal), build alpha,
                      negate, mirror (left->right) and mirror (top->
                      bottom) filters.
                    * added new tile sizes: 128x128 and 256x256.
                    * added new editor window zoom modes: 200% and 400%,
                      and changed 500% to 600%.
                    * added tile rotation (90 degrees left and right).
                    * tile driller can now load BMP and JPG files, too.
                    * took away key shortcuts to zoom modes, because
                      GTK started to mess up the keys.
                    * the code can now be compiled using visual c++.

v1.3 (15-Nov-2003): * optimized tile flipping and rotating, and tiled
                      view window updating.
                    * undo didn't work properly if the user used pen
                      and started to draw from a pixel, which was the
                      same color as the pen.
                    * now the pixel under the mouse pointer is
                      highlighted in the editor window.

v1.2 (01-Nov-2003): * tiled view window is not updated while the user
                      is holding the mouse button down by default,
                      to make the editor work faster.
                    * tiled and image window update modes can now be
                      selected from the view-menu.
                    * optimized window drawing a lot.
                    * added a toggle buttom for releasing the editor
                      window from the tile grid.
                    * added size menu to tiled window.
                    * made the editor window title a little clearer.
                    * adjusted the editor window's zoom options.
                    * tile driller can load PNG images of any size,
                      but will cut the data to fit into one of the
                      supported image sizes.
                    * loading a 64x64 image will set the view mode
                      correctly.

v1.1 (29-Oct-2003): * editor window's view selection determines the
                      buffer, which all operations affect.
                    * undo operation also saves undo data.
                    * a familiar checkered background can be seen
                      when alpha is near zero.
                    * editor and viewer default to RGBA now.
                    * trying to load a non-PNG image will not crash
                      tile driller any more.
                    * editor window title shows more information.
                    * added new tile size: 64x64.
                    * added new image size: 64x64.
                    * added tiled view window.
                    * added new editor window zoom mode: 500%.
                    * added more key shortcuts.
                    * optimized window drawing.
                    * migrated to GTK 2.0 (from 1.2).
                    * resizing the image preserves as much old data as
                      possible.

v1.0 (28-Oct-2003): * initial release.

1. TILE DRILLER?

tile driller is a small drawing program, which is targetted to people who
want to draw tile based graphics pixel by pixel. tile driller loads BMP, JPG,
PCX, PNG and TGA files, and saves PNG files with alpha. the editing takes
place in 32bit RGBA color space.


2. COMPILING?

make

if make gives errors, edit the makefile. or something.


3. USAGE?

USAGE: ./tiledriller

after this use your mouse to draw. the foreground color is assigned to
the left mouse button, the background color is assigned to the right
mouse button. you can also use the following keys:

memory window:

* cursor keys to move to the neighboring tiles

editor window:

* cursor keys to move to the neighboring tiles
* a, w, s and d to shift the tile
* x and y to flip the tile
* q and e to rotate the tile

NOTE! the view mode is also the space, which all drawing operations affect.
so if you are in RGB mode your pen affects only red, green and blue
components of the image.

few things about drawing:

a. opacity in the palette window is the value for the alpha channel.
b. all filters except the "build alpha"-filter operate on the pixels of
   the selected viewing mode. "build alpha"-filter goes through the
   image and sets the pixel's alpha value to zero if its RGB components
   match with the pen's foreground color, and if there is no match the alpha
   is set to 255.
c. mirror & blend -operators mirror the tile horizontally or vertically
   and then blend the mirrored part, using a linear or a stochastic
   alpha ramp, with the editor buffer.
d. the erosion operation uses the current foreground pen color as the
   background color for erosion. the pixels of all other colors are
   considered to be part of the image that will get eroded.
e. aggressive fill calculates the difference to the clicked pixel in
   the selected view mode space (RGBA, RGB or A), and if it is component
   wise less than the threshold (10), then the fill proceeds.
f. gradient fill works like aggressive fill, but it calculates the
   difference to the previous pixel, not to the initial pixel. The
   threshold here is 8.


4. REQUIREMENTS

currently tile driller requires:

* LINUX (hasn't been tested elsewhere)
* GTK 2.0
* LIBPNG, LIBJPEG and ZLIB (for reading and saving the images)


5. MOTIVATION?

i wrote tile driller, because i want to draw tile graphics pixel by pixel
in 32bit RGBA color space. GIMP cannot do this or any other paint program
i tried out on LINUX.
